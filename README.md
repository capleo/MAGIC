Here we store and share scripts used to conduct data analysis in Ferguson, Caproni et al. 2025 “A deficient CP24 allele in maize defines genetic variation for non-photochemical quenching and photosystem II efficiency in fluctuating light”, published on the Plant Cell. The script collection is mostly in R but some routines are conducted in bash. All details are given in scripts. The raw sequences obtained using Single Primer Enrichment Technology (SPET), used in this study, are available at the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home ), under project ID PRJEB67515.
